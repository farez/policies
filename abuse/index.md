# Use Restrictions

*Last updated: 10 May, 2020*

We are proud to our users them a better way to find work and hire people. We also recognize that technology is an amplifier: it can enable the helpful and the harmful. That’s why we’ve established this policy. If you have an account with At Work At Home, you can’t use them for any of the restricted purposes listed below. If we find out you are, we will block your account immediately and indefinitely.

## Restricted purposes

* **Child exploitation, sexualization, or abuse**: We don’t tolerate any activities that create, disseminate, or otherwise cause child abuse. Keep away and stop. Just stop.
* **Doxing**: If you are using At Work At Home to share other peoples’ private personal information for the purposes of harassment, we don’t want anything to do with you.
* **Infringing on intellectual property**: You can’t use At Work At Home to make or disseminate work that uses the intellectual property of others beyond the bounds of [fair use](https://www.copyright.gov/fair-use/more-info.html).
* **Malware or spyware**: Code for good, not evil. If you are using our products to make or distribute anything that qualifies as malware or spyware — including remote user surveillance — begone.
* **Phishing or otherwise attempting fraud**: It is not okay to lie about who you are or who you affiliate with to steal from, extort, or otherwise harm others.
* **Spamming**: No one wants unsolicited commercial emails. We don’t tolerate folks (including their bots) using At Work At Home for spamming purposes. If your messages and emails don’t pass muster with [CAN-SPAM](https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/can-spam-act-compliance-guide-business) or any other anti-spam law, it’s not allowed.
* **Violence, or threats thereof**: If an activity qualifies as violent crime in the United Kingdom or where you live, you may not use At Work At Home to plan, perpetrate, or threaten that activity.

We’ve outlined these restrictions to be clear about what we won’t stand for. That said, this list is by no means exhaustive. We will make changes over time.
